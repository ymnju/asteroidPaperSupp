## **Project Description**

This project includes scripts and functions for paper "Observational Strategies for Spin Inversion of Near-Earth Asteroids". The details of each file are as follows:

### ** Folder1: paperCodeV1 **
1. **`pltNeoParDis.py`**  
   Generate asteroid parameter statistics figures using downloaded data.

2. **`generate_triaxial_ellipsoid_obj.py`**  
   Generate triaxial ellipsoid models using the Octant Triangulation method as required.

3. **`ast_ecl_fun.py`**  
   Calculate the ecliptic coordinates of the Earth and Sun for a specified asteroid at a given time.

4. **`search_period.py`**  
   Use the Lomb-Scargle (LS) method and the Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM) method to search for asteroid rotational periods.

5. **`inverse_single_obj.py`**  
   Invert the parameters and morphology of a single asteroid.

6. **`damit_funs.py`**  
   Auxiliary functions for inverting asteroid parameters and morphology.

7. **`period_scan_parallel.py`**  
   Parallelized scanning of asteroid rotational periods.

### ** Folder2: simulateData.zip **

Some of the simulated data generated and used in this paper.
